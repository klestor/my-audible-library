window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the award-winning master of sci-fi Adrian Tchaikovsky, </b><b><i>Children of Memory</i></b><b> is the unmissable follow-up space opera to the highly acclaimed </b><b><i>Children of Time</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Children of Ruin</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>When Earth failed, it sent out arkships to establish new outposts. So the spaceship <i>Enkidu </i>and its captain, Heorest Holt, carried its precious human cargo to a potential new paradise. Generations later, this fragile colony has managed to survive on Imir, eking out a hardy existence. Yet life is tough, and much technological knowledge has been lost.</p> <p>Then strangers appear, on a world where everyone knows their neighbour. They possess unparalleled knowledge and thrilling new technology – for they have come from the stars, to help humanity’s lost colonies. But not all is as it seems on Imir.</p> <p>As the visitors lose track of time and memories, they discover the colonists fear unknown enemies and Imir’s own murky history. Neighbour turns against neighbour, as society fractures in the face of this terrifying foe. Perhaps some other intelligence is at work, toying with colonists and space-faring scientists alike? But not all questions are so easily answered – and the price may be the colony itself . . .</p> <p><b><i>Children of Memory </i></b><b>by Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning author Adrian Tchaikovsky is a far-reaching space opera spanning generations, species and galaxies.</b></p>";
