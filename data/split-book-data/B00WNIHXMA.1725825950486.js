window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The gates have opened the way to a thousand new worlds, and the rush to colonise has begun. Settlers looking for a new life stream out from humanity's home planets. Illus, the first human colony on this vast new frontier, is being born in blood and fire. Independent settlers stand against the overwhelming power of a corporate colony ship with only their determination, courage, and the skills learned in the long wars of home. Innocent scientists are slaughtered as they try to survey a new and alien world. </p> <p>James Holden and the crew of his one small ship are sent to make peace in the midst of war and sense in the heart of chaos. But the more he looks at it, the more Holden thinks the mission was meant to fail. And the whispers of a dead man remind him that the great galactic civilisation which once stood on this land is gone. And that something killed them. </p> <p><i>Cibola Burn</i> is the exhilarating fourth novel in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Expanse series, following the Hugo-nominated <i>Leviathan Wakes</i>, <i>Caliban's War</i>, and <i>Abaddon's Gate</i>.</p> <p><b>Please note</b>: The original recording has now been replaced with a new performance by Jefferson Mays. If you own this audiobook, simply re-download it from your library to access the new recording. </p>";
