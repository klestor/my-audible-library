Waxillium Ladrian has returned to the capital city of Elendel from the far-flung roughs. </p> <p>Elendel is crisscrossed by canals and railways, and towers reach for the sky, but this is still a city of dangers and of magic; Allomancy and Feruchemy can still change the world. Wax faces many more adventures. </p> <p>Sanderson is a master of rich worlds, appealing characters and gripping plots, and his return to Mistborn shows him at the height of his powers.</p>";
