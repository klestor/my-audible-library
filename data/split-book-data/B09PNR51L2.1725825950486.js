window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Have you, a friend or family member been living with undiagnosed autism?</p> <p>For every visibly autistic person you meet, there are countless 'masked' people who pass as neurotypical. They don't fit the stereotypical mould of autism and are often forced by necessity to mask who they are, spending their entire lives trying to hide their autistic traits. In particular, there is evidence that autism remains significantly undiagnosed in women, people of colour, trans and gender non-conforming people, many of whom are only now starting to recognise those traits later in life.</p> <p>Blending cutting-edge research, personal insights and practical exercises for self-expression, Dr Devon Price examines the phenomenon of 'masking', making a passionate argument for radical authenticity and non-conformity. A powerful call for change, <i>Unmasking Autism </i>gifts its listeners with the tools to uncover their true selves and build a new society—one where everyone can thrive on their own terms.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
