He's part of a Multiform Assault Pack operating in the lawless anarchy of Campeche, southeastern Mexico. He has the intelligence to carry out his orders and feedback implants to reward him when he does. All he wants to be is a Good Dog, and to do that he must do exactly what Master says. </p> <p>What happens when Master is tried as a war criminal? What rights does the Geneva Convention grant weapons? And what happens when Rex slips his leash?</p>";
