window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Visceral, disturbing and chilling in its realism, <i>World War Z </i>is perhaps the most famous work from the world's foremost expert on our undead counterparts. Paired with the equally gripping <i>The Zombie Survival Guide</i>, there is no better preparation for the inevitable uprising. </p> <p><i>\"The end was near.\"</i> Voices from the Zombie War. </p> <p>The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched firsthand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. </p> <p>He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living - or at least the undead - hell of that dreadful time. <i>World War Z</i> is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.</p>";
